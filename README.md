## Conclusion
The analysis indicates that married women aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, exhibit strong purchasing power, particularly in the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories. These insights can guide marketing and sales strategies for future Diwali seasons.
